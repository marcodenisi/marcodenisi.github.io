      <description>In Klarna, I work in a team called Post Purchase Decisioning (aka PPD). We take care of a product called Skan, which is used by internal stakeholders (called fraud agents) to work on all the orders in Klarna that can be fraudolent.
This is a story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down we approached the so called Peak Season (the range of time between the Black Friday and Christmax) and in detail, how we discovered and fixed a bottleneck.</description>

      <description>How many times did you have to integrate an external service? Every day we say sentences like:
 this HTTP call takes too long this stuff breaks all the times  All these complaints are typical when a remote call should be performed, especially when we have to deal with unresponsive systems, which can cause a cascade effect that can be hard to come back from.
This is even more true when we have to work with a microservices architecture with synchronous HTTP calls.</description>

      <title>Why you should use Conventional Commits</title>

      <description>Nowadays, versioning systems are used everywhere to simplify collaboration between developers working on the same codebase. That&amp;rsquo;s great, if it weren&amp;rsquo;t that, in the long run, commits history starts looking like this:
Has a commit introduced a breaking change? Any fix? Good luck finding the answer just looking at that: you&amp;rsquo;d better start walking in your open space asking who did what.
From this another problem arises. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have to decide the software version number.</description>

      <title>Github Actions: a concrete example with Hugo and Latex</title>

      <description>Months ago I decided to write my curriculum using Latex and to use Github to version it (here the repository). I said to myself that it would be beautiful to automatically create the latest cv version as a pdf file whenever I update the source files, maybe as a Github release.
I had the same desire when I started thinking about this blog: wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be amazing if at each new content, a new blog version was deployed automatically?</description>

      <description>During last weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked a lot with AWS Lambda.
The main challenge I had was to look for a method to locally test those functions. Of course, it is possible to do some partial code execution as part of unit/integration test setup, but that wonâ€™t be close enough to production setup.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to build a sort of how-to guide in order to have a reference in the future. To do so, I have to:</description>
