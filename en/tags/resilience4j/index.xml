      <description>How many times did you have to integrate an external service? Every day we say sentences like:
 this HTTP call takes too long this stuff breaks all the times  All these complaints are typical when a remote call should be performed, especially when we have to deal with unresponsive systems, which can cause a cascade effect that can be hard to come back from.
This is even more true when we have to work with a microservices architecture with synchronous HTTP calls.</description>
