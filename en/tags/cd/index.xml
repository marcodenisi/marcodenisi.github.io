      <description>Nowadays, versioning systems are used everywhere to simplify collaboration between developers working on the same codebase. That&amp;rsquo;s great, if it weren&amp;rsquo;t that, in the long run, commits history starts looking like this:
Has a commit introduced a breaking change? Any fix? Good luck finding the answer just looking at that: you&amp;rsquo;d better start walking in your open space asking who did what.

      <description>Months ago I decided to write my curriculum using Latex and to use Github to version it (here the repository). I said to myself that it would be beautiful to automatically create the latest cv version as a pdf file whenever I update the source files, maybe as a Github release.
I had the same desire when I started thinking about this blog: wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be amazing if at each new content, a new blog version was deployed automatically?</description>
